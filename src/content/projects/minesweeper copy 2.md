# About this project

## Context

This project was made in early-mid 2022 with two of my friends. It was build for a project assigned in Computer Science class in high school (Spé NSI if you are French).

## Features

This minesweeper isn't just like any minesweeper out there, it can do a lot more... Here are a few examples :

- 2 differents interfaces (CLI + Tkinter), however the GitHub Repo only contains the CLI. Sorry !
- Integrated fully functional timer
- Option to choose a name
- Statistics stored in a separated file (with times, W/L ratio, etc...)
- 3 built-in difficulty modes and 1 custom where you can choose board size and mine count yourself
- And much more !
